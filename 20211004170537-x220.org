** TODO recieve and test NanoHub usb multiplexer(s), see if I can use 2 of them to get 3 ports
[[https://www.smart-prototyping.com/index.php?route=account/order/info&order_id=37718][Order info, still processing?]]
1 for BitMagic, one for BlackMagic, one for USB-C 2.0 out
** Case modifications
*** TODO Cut out palmrest for JTAG/SWD and Logic Analyzer
Finalize how I will secure them first tho I mean it's whatever they're like $10
*** TODO Maybe model / print an expresscard slot thing to hold them
so I don't have to break the metal sleeve-thingy for expresscard devices
** BitMagic Logic Analyzer
*** TODO Write a script for clean interfacing
probably make it just bash, use sigrok-cli and maybe have like i2c easily decodable
** BlackMagic JTAG/SWD/UART Thingy
*** TODO Write a script for clean interfacing
5v not present on UART or jtag connectors ?? Lights on and stuff, maybe software/firmware setting???
idk what it'll be yet
*** TODO grok swd/jtag
probably watch like eevblog or something
* Software Stuff
** Emacs
*** TODO grok it
